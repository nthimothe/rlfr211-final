# French Travel Narratives Final Project
# About
This project is an interactive web site built with entirely with a Flask backend in Python to visualize 
the departure points of various, well-known explorers from the 15th and 16th centuries.

This site is deployed on the heroku cloud, and can be accessed via the following link: `https://explorateurs.herokuapp.com/`

Certain modules aren't included, so at this time it is impossible to host on your local machine.

I hope that over time I can add more information and visualizations to the site.
